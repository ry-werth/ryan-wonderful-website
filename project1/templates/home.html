            This Website is a playground for me. I use it to practice and play around.</br>
            It's built using Flask and hosted with Heroku.</br>
            Go checkout the book ranking system, it's the first part of the site.</br>
            Take a look around!</br>

        <div class="about-content">
            I was born and raised in San Francisco then went to study Physics at Cal Poly. After college, I worked at <a class="light-blue-text" href="https://www.runitonce.com/" target="_blank">Run It Once</a> doing web development. My job was remote and I spent this time travelling around South and Central America, Europe and Morocco. I learned most of what I know about programming on the job.</br></br>
            I like to surf, gamble on football, and brew kombucha. I'm not usually sitting still, but if I am, it's usually because I'm reading or trying to learn something new on the computer.
